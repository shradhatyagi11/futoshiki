# There are three main components of this project 

## Futoshiki_solver.py : 
  contains driver code and main method
## validators.py : 
  contains all the validations
## models.json : 
  contains different models of different grid size and sample solution to those models
  
## Executing Code :
  To execute the code you can either fork this repo or download complete solution and run futoshiki_solver.py
  
  Alternatively you can also visit [![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/shradhatyagi11/futoshiki)  to open virtual workspace   and execute code on GitPod.

## Adding new Models or Grid Sizes: 
  To add new models make an entry in models.json, code will randomly pick any model of chosen grid size and will present it     end user.
